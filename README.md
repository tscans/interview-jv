# JellyGit ðŸ“Š

Full Disclaimer - I went a little outside the line with this one but I really wanted to showcase React Native work. I kept the work to under 2 hours as per the instructions. 

JellyGit is a React Native application that provides insights into GitHub user activity. Built with Expo, it helps track development trends across projects by analyzing public GitHub activity.

## Features

- View GitHub user activity across their repositories
- Analyze top 3 most common activity types per repository
- Identify repositories owned by the user
- Clean, modern UI with intuitive navigation

## Demo

The app includes several key screens:

1. User Search - Find GitHub users to analyze
2. Activity Overview - See total activity across repositories
3. Repository Details - View specific repository activity
4. Activity Breakdown - Analyze activity types and patterns

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); gap: 10px; margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="assets/demo/1.png" alt="Demo 1" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px;"/>
  <img src="assets/demo/2.png" alt="Demo 2" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px;"/>
  <img src="assets/demo/3.png" alt="Demo 3" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px;"/>
  <img src="assets/demo/4.png" alt="Demo 4" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px;"/>
