This project is a React Native Expo project.
It has a backend that is the new Expo API routes.
We use tabs(4) not spaces.
API routes are either a POST or a GET and look like the following:

const handler = async (request: Request) => {
    return Response.json({});
}

export async function POST(request: Request) {
    return await handler(request);
}

Some react state is local to the component. But when it isn't, we use Jotai atoms.
Defined in the /state folder. 
It looks like this:

export const stepperAtom = atom<number>(0);

export const useStepper = () => {
    const [stepper, setStepper] = useAtom(stepperAtom);

    return {
        stepper,
        setStepper,
    }
}

New components go in the /components folder. 
They DO NOT go in the /app directory - that is for new pages/screens.
So DO NOT make a /app/components directory and put components in it.

STYLING
Use NativeWind wherever possible.
